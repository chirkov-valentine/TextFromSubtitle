          dai shi maat Lima peed on us           so I grew up on Long Island New York     as a young child there was a TV show     called Andy's gang the scene song was     God again everybody's good old Andy's     gang and they feature drama of the     jungle adaptations of Rudyard Kipling     and the boy Rama had just a gunshot yeah     turned them no shoes hung out in all     these temples in Bengali when he would     go to the temple he was here then     chanting Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna     Krishna Hari Rama     that was my first exposure to Krishna     consciousness now when I was in high     school probably tenth grade I guess     tenth grade a friend of mine a good     friend of mine     I had gone to castings school so I grew     up as a Catholic so a good friend of     mine Peter Campanella was in New York     City he came across historical     bachelor's gifts he bought a copy of an   album     we're probably chanting Hari Krishna     radhe Krishna Krishna Krishna           he brought this album home and called us     all up and said you guys are not gonna     believe what I found     he said what he said I got a     transmission here from a spaceman this     guy is out from outer space he's brought     a message I don't know if anybody's     deciphered it yet but he brought a     message and if you listen to him chant     you will go into ecstasy and do the     dance of ecstasy so we were all a little     white guys and little punks but we     thought how we gonna pass up listen to a     spaceman so we all got together and we     were smoking some hashish capitalist     house he had bongo drums and cymbals and     we started chanting and by the time the     chanting over we were in ecstasy and so     I still have the hardy krishna album and     so these guys had I store in Laguna     called the Brotherhood of eternal love   and they had they had a juice bar in the     bookstore and and a place you could sell     clothes and in the back they had a     meditation room and another guy who was     working there as it was Nandu Kumar he     and I became good friends we go in there     one day and here they are in the back     room Shankar     I had no idea anybody knew about sharing     car worship with us but we went back in     and dinner nos was there tomorrow     krishna was there several other devotees     were there they told us all about the     temple and that we had to go so we     decided we'd hitch up to LA and see what     the temple wasn't about and probably was     just arriving and everybody was just in     a tussle getting ready for property to     come I was still a hippie I had long     hair and a beard but the devotee said I     think I could go down to the flowers the     flower market and I could get some     flowers I can make a garland for a prop     odd and so improper came I made a     garland and he got off the airplane and          and I put the flowers around real     prophets nag and bent down and touched     his feet and you look down and said and     then so when will you be joining I     really didn't have an intention to join     then but I knew the way you looked into     my eyes that I would be joining soon     when the AIA I went back I went back to     Laguna many devoted friends who were     there alia alia was a god sister and     she was there Michelle you was she was     to me was one of the most mystic girls     I've ever met in my life     she was so spiritually minded and knew     everything about bhagavad-gita she could     preach so nicely so the whole time I was     living in Laguna I was going down to San     Diego to the self-realization fellowship     and all the people that lived there     although they all seemed nice and     sincere they they had hairdos like my     mother dead you know coming home from     the beauty parlor you know and they just     did not have the vibration to attract me     to a yoga lifestyle     whereas when I came to the temple all     the devotees were full of life and you     could tell that there was something     happening in them they were exuberant     with the devotional set sentiment     almost almost intoxicate caming to be     around them and you just wanted to know     what it was that they could have plugged     into that could have transformed their     life and made them feel so blissful and     while there wasn't anything lacking on a     mundane level in my life there was     something lacking deep in my heart and I     didn't feel complete and I felt a     yearning and that is what that is what     made the difference between other things     that I might have been looking at versus     my encounter with the devotees and so     then I went up to San Francisco made the     transaction met with Bob Rubin I went     down to the temple and went up to attend     Artie on to doodle is doing kirtan and I     want to do the was just ecstatic yurt     our leader and I saw the love of time to     do it immediately I accepted him as my   other guard brother and he had had a lot     of association with proper and could     just tell the most nectarine stories     about prop bud and so I shaved my head     that day and I joined the temple so that     was how I became a devotee what happened     was that George Harrison had given the     manor to the London devotees and there     was a shuffling around of personnel     improper wanted and proper wanted     constituted him avati to go to San     Francisco     well the Berkeley temple was so nude     there was no initiated devotees in the     Berkley temple so probably see is there     anyone suitable and honestly they said     yes there's one boy bhakta bill he would     be okay and so probably should already     sent him down and get him initiated and     so I flew down with a couple of what I     think four other devotees my wife I     believe low trying hard i nan de and we     all got initiated and that the     initiation robert explained that my     devotee named   was bahu Lhasa and he described that     bottle Lhasa was a king and he was a     great devotee of Krishna and he was     renowned for having many horses and he     said you have always had many horses and     always will have many horses and     therefore I give you this name many     horses and I grew up my family raised     and trained horses and all through my     adult life I had horses and even now as     I'm approaching in my life I still have     one horse that showed me that probably     was no ordinary person in my life and     that there are numerous instances when     probably read my mind where I was going     to see Shula proper and I've been     fretting about something or been in     anxiety and probably says so boy I saw     you've been thinking this and he would     know exactly what I had been thinking     and then I said would say yes your table     and then he said have you worked out the     solution and I would say no she'll     probably then he would say then I     recommend you do this what wasn't you          know and so then what surely happened     and this was a giant boon from me this     was a boner and I do not want to present     this and a way to glorify myself because     it was all profits grace     and I just happen to be in the right     place at the right time so I had no     college education III did not even think     of myself as an intellectual person and     here I was a temple president of Berkley     temple and for some reason one day this     gentleman came to the temple on Durant     and he was dr. Stillson Judah and he was     a head of the Berkeley Theological     Seminary and he told me he wanted to     compile a book about Krishna     consciousness and specifically what     makes a person become a devotee and so I     told them I asked properly but if I     could get permission and probably said     yes give him permission and so this     began a two-year project where we put     together questionnaires about background     what were your thoughts like before so     and so forth and we submit additional     problem he was very pleased with it and     dr. Judah went ahead and published his     books and he derived great notoriety for     doing this book was the first of its     kind and he derived great notoriety and     became very intimate with your problem     and because because of my contact like a     liaison between him every time for all     but one is he     dr. dr. Judah he would invite me down on     one of these walks with dr. Judah Sheila     proper was explaining that the way to     become Krishna conscious is through     practice the practice of devotional     service of sadhna and that if you don't     practice getting up in the morning going     to Aarti chanting Trivandrum geared to     them all the various ways to practice     devotional service then there's no     question of you becoming Krishna     conscious you can't become Krishna     conscious without engaging in the     activities of devotional service and so     I made some kind of comments some kind     of foolish comment come out of my mouth   about the importance of this or that     ensure a proper turned around and told     me that he had been explained this to me     for a hundred lifetimes and all of the     bodies went oh     as if that was a compliment that     properties had to come back a hundred     times to save me from ignorance but     profit actually meant at least I took it     in a way that this is how foolish you     are that after a hundred lifetimes     you're still not getting the message     that Krishna consciousness has to be     practiced can you say like that any     settings that's already yet maybe you     have not seen it but I've seen God     that is quite possible because we have     not scooted and it studied all the men     of the world yes then how we can say     nobody has said you have not seen the     man who are sinning     so they will not admit his fault he     accuse Aras nobody else in it what you     may not have seen but why you say no     Deus you have not seen that person who   has seen one     therefore you select     so the those people who wrote the Bible     never did not see God           that is when God is canvassing yeah     Krishna day let's eat and he still there     Robert you see now there's a few quick     instances but before I would jump to     them I would note that my dearest     dearest God brother and friend who     passed away just a few years ago     darling Joshua I joined the movement and     where I may have excelled in     organizational skills Dharma excelled in     academic skills and Dharma was able to     Dharma was able to take the entire     university curriculum and decipher it so     that we could have a class not just in     religious studies or a class in     archaeology and Hindu sociology and so     where I was where I had a robust college     program you know lecturing once or twice     a week Dharma with his brilliance turned     that into easy go to the University you          so it was it became a giant program we     made lots of devotees Kevin joined on     the basis of that and so the next     professor I got to meet was dr. Theodore     Rose AK and he was he was a I would say     a bigger intellectual     then doctor and shooter was and he     wanted to write a book the making of the     counterculture and so doctor dr. Julie     introduced him to me and I flew down to     said to LA and introduced him to brow     paws and somehow or other I became I     became the liaison person between the     professors and proper okay so dr. Rose     ACK and dr. Judah had different slants     okay dr. Rose Jack was the intellectual     and dr. Judah was more like an     administrator and so those conversations     took different twists and dr. Rose act     even though he would be sometimes     challenging to prappas view he was     always always highly respective of     Prabhas view and prophet had different     themes different themes that he would     discuss with these professors and one of     the themes that he discussed was life     comes from life and so this topic life     came comes from life this topic dr. Rose     act latched on to okay and he saw in     this a he saw in this a topic that he     could actually     make a mark in okay and he wrote a book     called the voice of the earth now the     premise of this book is very deep and I     won't go into it in his full scope well     I've read it a dozen times myself     so the idea is this how did the universe     come into being so let's not approach     this with any kind of bias okay let's     say that neither of us know how the     universe came into being right well we     have all this data and we're going to     try to compile this data and see if we     can indeed make some sense out of it so     yes so this is it here so you can see     how many times they're ready to that     cover is coming on and so the very first     notion that some whack ball scientists     put forth was that randomness who     described the evolution of life and the   idea the the kind of joke if you would     that they put together was if you put     together a million monkeys in a room     and they all typed away eventually they     would produce DNA that was their idea     and if the and so the premise on this is     if you had an infinite period of time     and because when this was proposed don't     believe how old the universe was so you     couldn't really debate it because give     it an infinite amount of time anything's     possible right certainly you know I mean     an infinite amount of time is just you     can't get your head around what an     infinite amount of time is well then as     that theory evolved the German who     calculated this is in this book it     became apparent there wasn't an infinite     amount of time the universe had a life     span thirteen and a half billion years     sounds like a lot of time right for the     pales in comparison to infinite and so     he's shown that there is not adequate     time for the monkeys to generate DNA and     typer and typing randomly   so he and Sheila prob pod Rosic put that     forth is said to show up Robert what do     you think of this idea now in light of     the thirteen and a half billion years     when I think just was not a morning walk     and probably said obviously that     thirteen billion and incident are not     the same and therefore it would be     impossible that such a thing could come     about and then rose like bid into that     and that became that got published in     this book and that became one of his     major lecturing points one thing that     stands out to me on a on a very intimate     note or Rafi archers and you know San     Francisco temple is do drug enough pours     that's what probably called it from the     beginning all the devotees who have     served there for any length of time     worship sugar that's in that spirit and     I love jogging the temple like I love     joking us forward and shield proud was     coming up to do what was called mantra     rock now there really wasn't a big     temple there yet but Allen Ginsberg who          was convinced seekers organize a big     kirtan and so I was own initiative     Ellen organised mantra rocked and all     the famous rock bands of the day played     janis joplin played you you just name it     they were there and there was a giant     success it really gave the feeling that     this gun was just going to now explode     and the very really gonna be holding     point and Country Joe and the fish were     there and this was a great event that it     was held as a family dog and the next     year we had another festival there I     didn't attend the mantra rock festival I     still a hippie on again but I attended     the second one and Nara na Ryan had     built the karts and we pulled them     through Golden Gate Park and proper     danced and proper danced it was like the     whole universe danced everyone went to     pure ecstasy was just magnificent and     when it was over Marley had rented a     vehicle some kind of a limo to pictural     profit up and takes your problem back to     the apartment that we were rented for     him     and when we got to the car I was     standing behind bottle Shila problem     with sitting a passenger side with his     legs on the ground and lot of Issa was     kneeling like this and he said did you     like his little problem     he'll probably grab me supplied the head     hands on his head and kissed and kissed     him     he said I loved it model visa that was     just no it's just another endearing     moment where I realized who the Guru was     what the real Joker guru was the aspect     that I had not seen before was the     intimacy was the loving sentiment that     the Guru has with the disciple it was     not simply some mechanical thing where     he came and like at a church made a     donation went away but there was a deep     bond of love between the Guru and the     disciple and then all you had to do was     engage in devotional service and you can     experience that directly for yourself     and so then we decided we were going to   do a Roth er I mean a Lord chain Tania     Festival and lo chat das was a great     artist he had been in the Berkeley     temple you joined before I did     he created the mercies of Lord Chaitanya     and they were life-sized and we paraded     them down the street and they moved in     their arms move and we then culminated     that at at People's Park and probably it     was very pleased with that event and           encouraged us to continue doing more     festivals and then and then issue upon     Ishod came out up until then we had been     just distributing back to Godhead within     the issue a partnership I came out so     hurry and I dine on then I we went out     in the evenings just the two of us and     distribu show up on Ishod and that was     very nice proper was really pleased with     that and then there was a practice where     different devotees would have the     opportunity to be probably servant for     some period of time and so usually a     problem would be travelling they might   be stopping at you know some temple and     you have an opportunity would there be a     window of time you have an opportunity     to go to be probably servant and so     problem was coming to New Bern da band     and there was a couple of weeks where no     one was designated to be his servant and     so I was offered the opportunity to do     that and so I was delighted and I took     it immediately and I bet I paid for our     party and would massage him with mustard     oil and rub sanded with face on his head     and sit next to him and span and itself     was very hot a new wind of it and one     night I was getting probably his bed     ready and I laid out all his sleeping     power Fidelia and probably was looking     out the window and he had a giant tulsi     said the toasting peacock feather that     has fallen from you know from worth it     is whis and he bent down and picked it     up and he began holding it over his face     and it was just chanting gold and           Bravo just became so overwhelmed with          world you know what to think or what to     say anything it was so touching and so     intimate     I was actually embarrassed it was as if     I had walked in on something very     intimate and should not have been even     engaging at it and then I picked up a     few other artifacts as falling in saying     that show progress room and when he was     finished then then I offer my humble     obeisances and walked away and there     were many instances where prophets     showed that his knowledge of Krishna was     not simply coming out of books what is     knowledge impersonal was based on the     fact that he knew personal when he     invokes firstly it was personal and then     we were in the process of getting a     temple in Chicago and I had saved up     Lakshmi to buy the building           it was very hard doing sankirtana in     Chicago because it was the median     capital of the world it was very demonic     and the winters were horrible and and     the luxury was thin and lean yes when I     first got there we had no water when my     name was threw me was pregnant we went     through the whole winter with no water     no hot water then a blessing from heaven     came horrible Jacques Acharya and part     of my honza to Brahma cherries from     Colorado arrived out of the blue and     they were there were such great Souls     they were so much fun so enthusiastic     never got tired and they just     revitalized my meager efforts and we     finally raised the money and my gone to     I got two new endowment to tell probably     you know that we raised the funds and           Sasa roof I've gone there before me he     was GBC when he insisted on another     building     that was a YMCA building and so he was     there for three or four days selling     probably how great type building was but     in my mind it was nothing but a headache     well when I got there was too late     problems was convinced we're going to   get that building this old and Suzi eyes     they go bald ah so so you've found the     building so big and what was I gonna say     right never said yes so we got that     building but I was always looking for an     opportunity to get out of there as     quickly as I could     and then finally chazuke Ananda Jitsu     Gironda I gone to I gone to Mexico City     and profits in your help and we were     friends     and so Chizu kindly invited me there and     then probably came to Mexico City oh my     god you could not believe that man it     was the Pope coming to Mexico City the     Mexican people are so devoted you know     it is just it's just Lawsons from their     heart and their reception she'll     probably was just amazing just amazing     and many many mayors     of towns and you know County ships and     stuff right what it probably come to     speak you know the q and A's were we're     not really philosophically profound as     much as they were love of God directed I   think that's what stood out mostly there     weren't doubters you know there weren't     there weren't oh oh why the you know     there was any of that there was they saw     probable part you know they saw who he     was they knew who he was and it was just     more take sheltered probably slow to see     and you know that kind of just loving     devotion well the most attractive     quality the most undeniable quality is     unalloyed devotion this I've never seen     in another human being     okay never seen anything like it     real love of God and they're you know     they're being due to my false ego you     know there have been little tweaks and     things here where I might have had got     puffed up and had some ego difference     you know between how this could be or     that could be philosophically you know     the mouth to anything they don't even     come close to the devotional sentiment     that you encounter when you see field     problems and when you're wearing this     services show problem I want to offer my          brothers and God sisters who I've had     the good fortune to know and to social     profile in this life     thank you all problems and properties     Oh glory soprano glories to lord     caitanya           right true           don't know                 you
