00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:18,760
dai shi maat Lima peed on us

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,810
[Music]

4
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,950
so I grew up on Long Island New York

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,110
as a young child there was a TV show

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:39,390
called Andy's gang the scene song was

7
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:54,670
God again everybody's good old Andy's

8
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,199
gang and they feature drama of the

9
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,349
jungle adaptations of Rudyard Kipling

10
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:11,799
and the boy Rama had just a gunshot yeah

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,830
turned them no shoes hung out in all

12
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,420
these temples in Bengali when he would

13
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,780
go to the temple he was here then

14
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,530
chanting Hari Krishna Krishna Krishna

15
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,020
Krishna Hari Rama

16
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,480
that was my first exposure to Krishna

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:44,680
consciousness now when I was in high

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,200
school probably tenth grade I guess

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,830
tenth grade a friend of mine a good

20
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,880
friend of mine

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,710
I had gone to castings school so I grew

22
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,220
up as a Catholic so a good friend of

23
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,780
mine Peter Campanella was in New York

24
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,630
City he came across historical

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,660
bachelor's gifts he bought a copy of an

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,350
album

27
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,010
we're probably chanting Hari Krishna

28
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,500
radhe Krishna Krishna Krishna

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:35,159
[Music]

30
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:39,719
he brought this album home and called us

31
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,739
all up and said you guys are not gonna

32
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,430
believe what I found

33
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,400
he said what he said I got a

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,769
transmission here from a spaceman this

35
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,239
guy is out from outer space he's brought

36
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,129
a message I don't know if anybody's

37
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,519
deciphered it yet but he brought a

38
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,700
message and if you listen to him chant

39
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,709
you will go into ecstasy and do the

40
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,359
dance of ecstasy so we were all a little

41
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:22,049
white guys and little punks but we

42
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,359
thought how we gonna pass up listen to a

43
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:28,319
spaceman so we all got together and we

44
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,370
were smoking some hashish capitalist

45
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,049
house he had bongo drums and cymbals and

46
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,829
we started chanting and by the time the

47
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:49,290
chanting over we were in ecstasy and so

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,000
I still have the hardy krishna album and

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,180
so these guys had I store in Laguna

50
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,189
called the Brotherhood of eternal love

51
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:06,269
and they had they had a juice bar in the

52
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,759
bookstore and and a place you could sell

53
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,939
clothes and in the back they had a

54
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:19,589
meditation room and another guy who was

55
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,430
working there as it was Nandu Kumar he

56
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,509
and I became good friends we go in there

57
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,880
one day and here they are in the back

58
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,930
room Shankar

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,830
I had no idea anybody knew about sharing

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,150
car worship with us but we went back in

61
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,009
and dinner nos was there tomorrow

62
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,819
krishna was there several other devotees

63
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,419
were there they told us all about the

64
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,969
temple and that we had to go so we

65
00:04:57,969 --> 00:05:00,520
decided we'd hitch up to LA and see what

66
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,259
the temple wasn't about and probably was

67
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:13,150
just arriving and everybody was just in

68
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,169
a tussle getting ready for property to

69
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:20,949
come I was still a hippie I had long

70
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,919
hair and a beard but the devotee said I

71
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,180
think I could go down to the flowers the

72
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,169
flower market and I could get some

73
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,690
flowers I can make a garland for a prop

74
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,860
odd and so improper came I made a

75
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,949
garland and he got off the airplane and

76
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,199
walked out to the car and I bowed down

77
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,889
and I put the flowers around real

78
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,379
prophets nag and bent down and touched

79
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:09,789
his feet and you look down and said and

80
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,659
then so when will you be joining I

81
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,650
really didn't have an intention to join

82
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:26,199
then but I knew the way you looked into

83
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,849
my eyes that I would be joining soon

84
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:40,520
when the AIA I went back I went back to

85
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,320
Laguna many devoted friends who were

86
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:53,390
there - alia - alia was a god sister and

87
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:00,350
she was there Michelle you was she was

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,990
to me was one of the most mystic girls

89
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,860
I've ever met in my life

90
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,460
she was so spiritually minded and knew

91
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,650
everything about bhagavad-gita she could

92
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,600
preach so nicely so the whole time I was

93
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,020
living in Laguna I was going down to San

94
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,360
Diego to the self-realization fellowship

95
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,240
and all the people that lived there

96
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,340
although they all seemed nice and

97
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:47,030
sincere they they had hairdos like my

98
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,300
mother dead you know coming home from

99
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,120
the beauty parlor you know and they just

100
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,130
did not have the vibration to attract me

101
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,410
to a yoga lifestyle

102
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,070
whereas when I came to the temple all

103
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,630
the devotees were full of life and you

104
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,430
could tell that there was something

105
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:26,250
happening in them they were exuberant

106
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,860
with the devotional set sentiment

107
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,950
almost almost intoxicate caming to be

108
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,900
around them and you just wanted to know

109
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,150
what it was that they could have plugged

110
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,510
into that could have transformed their

111
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,550
life and made them feel so blissful and

112
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,150
while there wasn't anything lacking on a

113
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,750
mundane level in my life there was

114
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,340
something lacking deep in my heart and I

115
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,030
didn't feel complete and I felt a

116
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:16,090
yearning and that is what that is what

117
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,780
made the difference between other things

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,200
that I might have been looking at versus

119
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,570
my encounter with the devotees and so

120
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,450
then I went up to San Francisco made the

121
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,550
transaction met with Bob Rubin I went

122
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,070
down to the temple and went up to attend

123
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:52,780
Artie on to doodle is doing kirtan and I

124
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,170
want to do the was just ecstatic yurt

125
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,000
our leader and I saw the love of time to

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,210
do it immediately I accepted him as my

127
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,100
other guard brother and he had had a lot

128
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,520
of association with proper and could

129
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,460
just tell the most nectarine stories

130
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,370
about prop bud and so I shaved my head

131
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,520
that day and I joined the temple so that

132
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,720
was how I became a devotee what happened

133
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:38,380
was that George Harrison had given the

134
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,880
manor to the London devotees and there

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,100
was a shuffling around of personnel

136
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,610
improper wanted and proper wanted

137
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,370
constituted him avati to go to San

138
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,830
Francisco

139
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,690
well the Berkeley temple was so nude

140
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,000
there was no initiated devotees in the

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,740
Berkley temple so probably see is there

142
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,560
anyone suitable and honestly they said

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,770
yes there's one boy bhakta bill he would

144
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,339
be okay and so probably should already

145
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,830
sent him down and get him initiated and

146
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,260
so I flew down with a couple of what I

147
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,060
think four other devotees my wife I

148
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,480
believe low trying hard i nan de and we

149
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,190
all got initiated and that the

150
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,520
initiation robert explained that my

151
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,420
devotee named

152
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,860
was bahu Lhasa and he described that

153
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,940
bottle Lhasa was a king and he was a

154
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,390
great devotee of Krishna and he was

155
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,430
renowned for having many horses and he

156
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,990
said you have always had many horses and

157
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,860
always will have many horses and

158
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,720
therefore I give you this name many

159
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,180
horses and I grew up my family raised

160
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,690
and trained horses and all through my

161
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:39,120
adult life I had horses and even now as

162
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,050
I'm approaching in my life I still have

163
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,640
one horse that showed me that probably

164
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,780
was no ordinary person in my life and

165
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:55,500
that there are numerous instances when

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,880
probably read my mind where I was going

167
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,720
to see Shula proper and I've been

168
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,090
fretting about something or been in

169
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,040
anxiety and probably says so boy I saw

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,070
you've been thinking this and he would

171
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,420
know exactly what I had been thinking

172
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,880
and then I said would say yes your table

173
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,520
and then he said have you worked out the

174
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,820
solution and I would say no she'll

175
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,060
probably then he would say then I

176
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,120
recommend you do this what wasn't you

177
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,390
saying right who can do that to you you

178
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,280
know and so then what surely happened

179
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,560
and this was a giant boon from me this

180
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,490
was a boner and I do not want to present

181
00:13:53,490 --> 00:14:03,720
this and a way to glorify myself because

182
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,780
it was all profits grace

183
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:11,700
and I just happen to be in the right

184
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,440
place at the right time so I had no

185
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,230
college education III did not even think

186
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:28,010
of myself as an intellectual person and

187
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,470
here I was a temple president of Berkley

188
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:37,560
temple and for some reason one day this

189
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,610
gentleman came to the temple on Durant

190
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,320
and he was dr. Stillson Judah and he was

191
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,710
a head of the Berkeley Theological

192
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,910
Seminary and he told me he wanted to

193
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,690
compile a book about Krishna

194
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,130
consciousness and specifically what

195
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,170
makes a person become a devotee and so I

196
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,010
told them I asked properly but if I

197
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,610
could get permission and probably said

198
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,690
yes give him permission and so this

199
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,220
began a two-year project where we put

200
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,330
together questionnaires about background

201
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,580
what were your thoughts like before so

202
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,750
and so forth and we submit additional

203
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,150
problem he was very pleased with it and

204
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:42,270
dr. Judah went ahead and published his

205
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:47,520
books and he derived great notoriety for

206
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,620
doing this book was the first of its

207
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,560
kind and he derived great notoriety and

208
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,660
became very intimate with your problem

209
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:10,320
and because because of my contact like a

210
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,190
liaison between him every time for all

211
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,879
but one is he

212
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:24,620
dr. dr. Judah he would invite me down on

213
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,959
one of these walks with dr. Judah Sheila

214
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,019
proper was explaining that the way to

215
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,149
become Krishna conscious is through

216
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:34,129
practice the practice of devotional

217
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:37,100
service of sadhna and that if you don't

218
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,949
practice getting up in the morning going

219
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,129
to Aarti chanting Trivandrum geared to

220
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,079
them all the various ways to practice

221
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:48,819
devotional service then there's no

222
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,139
question of you becoming Krishna

223
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:52,670
conscious you can't become Krishna

224
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,709
conscious without engaging in the

225
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:58,129
activities of devotional service and so

226
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,420
I made some kind of comments some kind

227
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,480
of foolish comment come out of my mouth

228
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,959
about the importance of this or that

229
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,280
ensure a proper turned around and told

230
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,459
me that he had been explained this to me

231
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,359
for a hundred lifetimes and all of the

232
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,849
bodies went oh

233
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,530
as if that was a compliment that

234
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,510
properties had to come back a hundred

235
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,270
times to save me from ignorance but

236
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,880
profit actually meant at least I took it

237
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,460
in a way that this is how foolish you

238
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,440
are that after a hundred lifetimes

239
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,289
you're still not getting the message

240
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,750
that Krishna consciousness has to be

241
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,880
practiced can you say like that any

242
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,330
settings that's already yet maybe you

243
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,520
have not seen it but I've seen God

244
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,610
that is quite possible because we have

245
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,710
not scooted and it studied all the men

246
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,260
of the world yes then how we can say

247
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,230
nobody has said you have not seen the

248
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,100
man who are sinning

249
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:08,360
so they will not admit his fault he

250
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,600
accuse Aras nobody else in it what you

251
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
may not have seen but why you say no

252
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,110
Deus you have not seen that person who

253
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,450
has seen one

254
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,960
therefore you select

255
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,250
so the those people who wrote the Bible

256
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,200
never did not see God

257
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,650
[Music]

258
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:42,190
that is when God is canvassing yeah

259
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:48,380
Krishna day let's eat and he still there

260
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,260
Robert you see now there's a few quick

261
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,960
instances but before I would jump to

262
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,050
them I would note that my dearest

263
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,380
dearest God brother and friend who

264
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,250
passed away just a few years ago

265
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,450
darling Joshua I joined the movement and

266
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,360
where I may have excelled in

267
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,800
organizational skills Dharma excelled in

268
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:30,700
academic skills and Dharma was able to

269
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,630
Dharma was able to take the entire

270
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:40,460
university curriculum and decipher it so

271
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,760
that we could have a class not just in

272
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,950
religious studies or a class in

273
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,330
archaeology and Hindu sociology and so

274
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:58,400
where I was where I had a robust college

275
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,830
program you know lecturing once or twice

276
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:10,010
a week Dharma with his brilliance turned

277
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,820
that into easy go to the University you

278
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,990
do three or four lectures at a time and

279
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,220
so it was it became a giant program we

280
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,210
made lots of devotees Kevin joined on

281
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:31,040
the basis of that and so the next

282
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,240
professor I got to meet was dr. Theodore

283
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,360
Rose AK and he was he was a I would say

284
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,770
a bigger intellectual

285
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,770
then doctor and shooter was and he

286
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,429
wanted to write a book the making of the

287
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:00,790
counterculture and so doctor dr. Julie

288
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:04,600
introduced him to me and I flew down to

289
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,630
said to LA and introduced him to brow

290
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,929
paws and somehow or other I became I

291
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:18,910
became the liaison person between the

292
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,650
professors and proper okay so dr. Rose

293
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:30,940
ACK and dr. Judah had different slants

294
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,220
okay dr. Rose Jack was the intellectual

295
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:44,040
and dr. Judah was more like an

296
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,760
administrator and so those conversations

297
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,800
took different twists and dr. Rose act

298
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,610
even though he would be sometimes

299
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:05,140
challenging to prappas view he was

300
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,130
always always highly respective of

301
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,570
Prabhas view and prophet had different

302
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:17,710
themes different themes that he would

303
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,910
discuss with these professors and one of

304
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,990
the themes that he discussed was life

305
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,510
comes from life and so this topic life

306
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,600
came comes from life this topic dr. Rose

307
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:48,280
act latched on to okay and he saw in

308
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,050
this a he saw in this a topic that he

309
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,670
could actually

310
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:04,059
make a mark in okay and he wrote a book

311
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:08,170
called the voice of the earth now the

312
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,030
premise of this book is very deep and I

313
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,340
won't go into it in his full scope well

314
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,299
I've read it a dozen times myself

315
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:26,440
so the idea is this how did the universe

316
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,390
come into being so let's not approach

317
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:37,630
this with any kind of bias okay let's

318
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,990
say that neither of us know how the

319
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,770
universe came into being right well we

320
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:52,900
have all this data and we're going to

321
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,490
try to compile this data and see if we

322
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,320
can indeed make some sense out of it so

323
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,710
yes so this is it here so you can see

324
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,530
how many times they're ready to that

325
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:22,750
cover is coming on and so the very first

326
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,549
notion that some whack ball scientists

327
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:33,160
put forth was that randomness who

328
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,370
described the evolution of life and the

329
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,220
idea the the kind of joke if you would

330
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,309
that they put together was if you put

331
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,900
together a million monkeys in a room

332
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,919
and they all typed away eventually they

333
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,250
would produce DNA that was their idea

334
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:12,029
and if the and so the premise on this is

335
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:18,840
if you had an infinite period of time

336
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,279
and because when this was proposed don't

337
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,450
believe how old the universe was so you

338
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,850
couldn't really debate it because give

339
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,730
it an infinite amount of time anything's

340
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:40,570
possible right certainly you know I mean

341
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,240
an infinite amount of time is just you

342
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,799
can't get your head around what an

343
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,950
infinite amount of time is well then as

344
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,399
that theory evolved the German who

345
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,730
calculated this is in this book it

346
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,279
became apparent there wasn't an infinite

347
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,539
amount of time the universe had a life

348
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:14,190
span thirteen and a half billion years

349
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:20,500
sounds like a lot of time right for the

350
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,309
pales in comparison to infinite and so

351
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:32,799
he's shown that there is not adequate

352
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:40,360
time for the monkeys to generate DNA and

353
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,980
typer and typing randomly

354
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,150
so he and Sheila prob pod Rosic put that

355
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,570
forth is said to show up Robert what do

356
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,080
you think of this idea now in light of

357
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,420
the thirteen and a half billion years

358
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,780
when I think just was not a morning walk

359
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:11,100
and probably said obviously that

360
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,900
thirteen billion and incident are not

361
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,570
the same and therefore it would be

362
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,780
impossible that such a thing could come

363
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,530
about and then rose like bid into that

364
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,600
and that became that got published in

365
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,540
this book and that became one of his

366
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:43,260
major lecturing points one thing that

367
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,380
stands out to me on a on a very intimate

368
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:57,580
note or Rafi archers and you know San

369
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,350
Francisco temple is do drug enough pours

370
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,880
that's what probably called it from the

371
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,330
beginning all the devotees who have

372
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,640
served there for any length of time

373
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,930
worship sugar that's in that spirit and

374
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:21,670
I love jogging the temple like I love

375
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:27,880
joking us forward and shield proud was

376
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,490
coming up to do what was called mantra

377
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,140
rock now there really wasn't a big

378
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:42,910
temple there yet but Allen Ginsberg who

379
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,570
wrote the introduction to bhagavad-gita

380
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,960
was convinced seekers organize a big

381
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,490
kirtan and so I was own initiative

382
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:00,510
Ellen organised mantra rocked and all

383
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,270
the famous rock bands of the day played

384
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,190
janis joplin played you you just name it

385
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,520
they were there and there was a giant

386
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,220
success it really gave the feeling that

387
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,480
this gun was just going to now explode

388
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,830
and the very really gonna be holding

389
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,340
point and Country Joe and the fish were

390
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,670
there and this was a great event that it

391
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,840
was held as a family dog and the next

392
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,500
year we had another festival there I

393
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,130
didn't attend the mantra rock festival I

394
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,500
still a hippie on again but I attended

395
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,160
the second one and Nara na Ryan had

396
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,610
built the karts and we pulled them

397
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,690
through Golden Gate Park and proper

398
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:16,110
danced and proper danced it was like the

399
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,250
whole universe danced everyone went to

400
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:26,690
pure ecstasy was just magnificent and

401
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,460
when it was over Marley had rented a

402
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,950
vehicle some kind of a limo to pictural

403
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,490
profit up and takes your problem back to

404
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,460
the apartment that we were rented for

405
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,549
him

406
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:51,080
and when we got to the car I was

407
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,830
standing behind bottle Shila problem

408
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:01,070
with sitting a passenger side with his

409
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,929
legs on the ground and lot of Issa was

410
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,640
kneeling like this and he said did you

411
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,000
like his little problem

412
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,970
he'll probably grab me supplied the head

413
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,470
hands on his head and kissed and kissed

414
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,299
him

415
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:32,179
he said I loved it model visa that was

416
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,980
just no it's just another endearing

417
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:44,289
moment where I realized who the Guru was

418
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:52,270
what the real Joker guru was the aspect

419
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,750
that I had not seen before was the

420
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:05,659
intimacy was the loving sentiment that

421
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,010
the Guru has with the disciple it was

422
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,470
not simply some mechanical thing where

423
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,000
he came and like at a church made a

424
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,049
donation went away but there was a deep

425
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,100
bond of love between the Guru and the

426
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,070
disciple and then all you had to do was

427
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,159
engage in devotional service and you can

428
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,740
experience that directly for yourself

429
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:51,009
and so then we decided we were going to

430
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,249
do a Roth er I mean a Lord chain Tania

431
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:58,929
Festival and lo chat das was a great

432
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:00,879
artist he had been in the Berkeley

433
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,649
temple you joined before I did

434
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,809
he created the mercies of Lord Chaitanya

435
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:13,359
and they were life-sized and we paraded

436
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,609
them down the street and they moved in

437
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:19,389
their arms move and we then culminated

438
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:26,529
that at at People's Park and probably it

439
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:30,410
was very pleased with that event and

440
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,710
[Music]

441
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,450
encouraged us to continue doing more

442
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:40,479
festivals and then and then issue upon

443
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:45,629
Ishod came out up until then we had been

444
00:33:45,629 --> 00:33:50,979
just distributing back to Godhead within

445
00:33:50,979 --> 00:33:54,700
the issue a partnership I came out so

446
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,840
hurry and I dine on then I we went out

447
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,279
in the evenings just the two of us and

448
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:06,489
distribu show up on Ishod and that was

449
00:34:06,489 --> 00:34:09,069
very nice proper was really pleased with

450
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:16,619
that and then there was a practice where

451
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:20,109
different devotees would have the

452
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:24,039
opportunity to be probably servant for

453
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,699
some period of time and so usually a

454
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:31,029
problem would be travelling they might

455
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,849
be stopping at you know some temple and

456
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:38,829
you have an opportunity would there be a

457
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,859
window of time you have an opportunity

458
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:47,739
to go to be probably servant and so

459
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:50,780
problem was coming to New Bern da band

460
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:56,210
and there was a couple of weeks where no

461
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:00,590
one was designated to be his servant and

462
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,770
so I was offered the opportunity to do

463
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,430
that and so I was delighted and I took

464
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:15,350
it immediately and I bet I paid for our

465
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,700
party and would massage him with mustard

466
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,400
oil and rub sanded with face on his head

467
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,080
and sit next to him and span and itself

468
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,300
was very hot a new wind of it and one

469
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,960
night I was getting probably his bed

470
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,270
ready and I laid out all his sleeping

471
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:48,500
power Fidelia and probably was looking

472
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,340
out the window and he had a giant tulsi

473
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,410
said the toasting peacock feather that

474
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,910
has fallen from you know from worth it

475
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:08,360
is whis and he bent down and picked it

476
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,790
up and he began holding it over his face

477
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,010
and it was just chanting gold and

478
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,609
[Music]

479
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:26,810
Bravo just became so overwhelmed with

480
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:33,250
ecstasy and I was just I was just the

481
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:41,720
world you know what to think or what to

482
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:49,849
say anything it was so touching and so

483
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:50,660
intimate

484
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:55,130
I was actually embarrassed it was as if

485
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,470
I had walked in on something very

486
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:04,760
intimate and should not have been even

487
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,819
engaging at it and then I picked up a

488
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:15,890
few other artifacts as falling in saying

489
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,940
that show progress room and when he was

490
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,430
finished then then I offer my humble

491
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:32,060
obeisances and walked away and there

492
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,329
were many instances where prophets

493
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:40,369
showed that his knowledge of Krishna was

494
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,390
not simply coming out of books what is

495
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,410
knowledge impersonal was based on the

496
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:57,740
fact that he knew personal when he

497
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:07,900
invokes firstly it was personal and then

498
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,930
we were in the process of getting a

499
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:25,510
temple in Chicago and I had saved up

500
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,500
Lakshmi to buy the building

501
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,049
[Music]

502
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:36,019
it was very hard doing sankirtana in

503
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:39,289
Chicago because it was the median

504
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,660
capital of the world it was very demonic

505
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:48,700
and the winters were horrible and and

506
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:57,230
the luxury was thin and lean yes when I

507
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,579
first got there we had no water when my

508
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:06,739
name was threw me was pregnant we went

509
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:10,069
through the whole winter with no water

510
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:15,769
no hot water then a blessing from heaven

511
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:23,869
came horrible Jacques Acharya and part

512
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,499
of my honza to Brahma cherries from

513
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:33,670
Colorado arrived out of the blue and

514
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,680
they were there were such great Souls

515
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,749
they were so much fun so enthusiastic

516
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:45,549
never got tired and they just

517
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:51,380
revitalized my meager efforts and we

518
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:58,640
finally raised the money and my gone to

519
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,960
I got two new endowment to tell probably

520
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,040
you know that we raised the funds and

521
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,109
[Music]

522
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:14,690
Sasa roof I've gone there before me he

523
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:20,150
was GBC when he insisted on another

524
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,010
building

525
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:27,650
that was a YMCA building and so he was

526
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:33,950
there for three or four days selling

527
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,210
probably how great type building was but

528
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:41,380
in my mind it was nothing but a headache

529
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,940
well when I got there was too late

530
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,869
problems was convinced we're going to

531
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:50,000
get that building this old and Suzi eyes

532
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,369

533
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:56,510
building so big and what was I gonna say

534
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:04,970
right never said yes so we got that

535
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,460
building but I was always looking for an

536
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,550
opportunity to get out of there as

537
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,840
quickly as I could

538
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,540
and then finally chazuke Ananda Jitsu

539
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:23,720
Gironda I gone to I gone to Mexico City

540
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,250

friends

542
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,580
and so Chizu kindly invited me there and

543
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:39,500
then probably came to Mexico City oh my

544
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,580
god you could not believe that man it

545
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:49,850
was the Pope coming to Mexico City the

546
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:54,250
Mexican people are so devoted you know

547
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,510
it is just it's just Lawsons from their

548
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,810
heart and their reception - she'll

549
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,440
probably was just amazing just amazing

550
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,340
and many many mayors

551
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,010
of towns and you know County ships and

552
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,790
stuff right what it probably come to

553
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:29,480
speak you know the q and A's were we're

554
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,920
not really philosophically profound as

555
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,280
much as they were love of God directed I

556
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,920
think that's what stood out mostly there

557
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,490
weren't doubters you know there weren't

558
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,520
there weren't oh oh why the you know

559
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,660
there was any of that there was they saw

560
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,930
probable part you know they saw who he

561
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:02,930
was they knew who he was and it was just

562
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:07,070
more take sheltered probably slow to see

563
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,730
and you know that kind of just loving

564
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:16,130
devotion well the most attractive

565
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:21,760
quality the most undeniable quality is

566
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,840
unalloyed devotion this I've never seen

567
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,500
in another human being

568
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:34,570
okay never seen anything like it

569
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:39,860
real love of God and they're you know

570
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,570
they're being due to my false ego you

571
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,530
know there have been little tweaks and

572
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,790
things here where I might have had got

573
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:59,660
puffed up and had some ego difference

574
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,170
you know between how this could be or

575
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:10,550
that could be philosophically you know

576
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,150
the mouth to anything they don't even

577
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:22,370
come close to the devotional sentiment

578
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,860
that you encounter when you see field

579
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,390
